SDL2 Erlang NIF.

Status
------

Week-end project. Work in progress.

The following limitations apply:

 *  Erlang 17.0+ is required
 *  SDL 2.0.3+ is required
 *  No support for UTF-8 strings, only Latin-1

The following ideas need to be investigated:

 *  We may benefit from the reference receive optimization when doing calls
 *  We may want a way to pipeline draw operations
 *  Using HiPE mutable bytearrays for "void* pixels" types

The following tasks remain to be done:

* http://hg.libsdl.org/SDL/file/default/include/SDL_hints.h
  * We need to implement everything.

* http://hg.libsdl.org/SDL/file/default/include/SDL_error.h
  * Anything that can produce errors will have an automatic call to SDL_GetError.
  * I am not sure we need any direct access to those functions.

* http://hg.libsdl.org/SDL/file/default/include/SDL_log.h
  * We already have logging in Erlang. Not sure we need this.

* http://hg.libsdl.org/SDL/file/default/include/SDL_assert.h
  * I am not sure we need this, and we can't use the assert macro directly anyway.

* http://hg.libsdl.org/SDL/file/default/include/SDL_version.h
  * It might be useful to provide access to some of the macros as functions.
  * The SDL_GetRevisionNumber function needs to be implemented.
  * It might be interesting to use the macros to conditionally implement some features,
    this way we could be compatible with all versions >= 2.0.0.

* http://hg.libsdl.org/SDL/file/default/include/SDL_video.h
  * The SDL_DisplayMode structure and related functions need to be implemented:

    * SDL_GetClosestDisplayMode()
